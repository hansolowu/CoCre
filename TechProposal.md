#Frontend:

### A cocre flavored markdown
To provide better presentation for KEYSTONE and discussion
maybe a web editor tool?

### Discussion board
CHECKPOINT oriented, not issue oriented. Should be able to easily quote from works.

### Tree + Steps like file presentation
Since progression is important, not just end product

### keep resource/progression files, but de-cluster them

### Parallel view on parallel works

### SVG rendering

#Backend

### All the important git stuff, version control, backup etc

### PSD file parser and possible Layer support

### JS execution in SVG
nvm use <img> tag
