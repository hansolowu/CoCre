(Everything mentioned in this document is purely my own proposal, I am happy and eager to listen any critics/advises and willing to change anything.)

## What is SPAF?

  It means special af.
  kidding

  > SPAF stands for *Share, Parallelism, Acceptance* and *Freedom*.

### Ok....?

  *Sharing* is quite straightforward, being a collaborative open source creative project, we welcome any contribution for everyone, and we happy to share our creations with anyone.

  In a programming project with multiple contributors, making collective decision is relatively easy, by judging the speed, running cost etc we can usually tell what is good and bad.
  In a artistic project, can we even make an objectively decision? probably no.
  My answer is simple: We shouldn't even bother.
  Different subjective views are just different ways to look at the same object, different approaches can easily co-exist in *Parallel*.
  Let's use the example of spider-man ans spider-verse (I'm going to use this example a lot):
    A group of creators decide to come together and make a spider man comic, should this new spider-man be tall? short? skinny? Fat? In an open source project where there is no real project leader with absolute power to make decisions, what should they do?
    Well, I believe that all those different version of spider-man can co-exist in parallel, every member of this creative team can come up with their own design/draft, do some initial work, all the member should be able to borrow resources like background setting and story lines from others' work, all member should also help each other to develop all those different approaches.
    This goes back to our first principle: Share your efforts with people you disagree with.
    In the end, a most appealing spider-mans should win the most amount of contribution, thus finishing first, sadly maybe some version of spider-man did not get enough traction/contribution from everyone and couldn't paint the full picture, but that's ok, it is still meaningful and maybe people will help you finish this version later on.

  What group creators together to actually finish something is *Acceptance*.
  We all acknowledge that online creative work is such a highly subjective realm with no power structure or any contractual binding between participants. Everyone is free to help or leave. We all have to accept and compromise our difference to a reasonable degree in order to achieve a common goal.

  Which lead us to the *Freedom* of content creation.
  There shouldn't be any standards for right or wrong, good or bad, high quality or low quality, to stop creators from creating their own work. We are free to contribute to any project we want, and free to step away from any vision we disagree with, especially in a open source project where there is no real authorities/leaders/directors to dictate the direction of a project.
  If you have a vision, like story you want to turn into manga, the only way you can convince people to join you, to help you, to collectively turn this dream into real content, is to lead with your work, to convince people with your plan, to unite people with acceptance. Because you have the freedom to ask for help, and people have the freedom to help you.

### Let's go into details then.

  A project should always start with a **KEYSTONE**.
  A KEYSTONE is the central principle/arc/style/story/character design, etc., on which all else depends.
  An individual or a group of creators should always come up with a convincing KEYSTONE to attract contributors, they should be in general agreement with your KEYSTONE proposal before contributing to your project.
  You can look at KEYSTONE like a movie trailer, to draw creators to your project.

  Contributors should decide the **BLUEPRINT** next. To divide story into chapters/sections? to have a rough script to follow? character development?
  Setting out a plan for the project is important because it allow parallel and efficient work flow. If the project is story oriented, a strong script would very helpful. if the project is like a character biography, then you need to plan out the progression.

  Step into actual work, it is smart to have a collective **RESOURCES** pool, is there common scene? character motion design? logo/pattern/clothing? Maybe draw up some character's face view from different angle, with different expression.
  Throughout the project, creators should continue adding to the resource pool.

  In the end, there should be a standard **WORKFLOW**, which sets the standard from sketch to final work. It can consist some standard **CHECKPOINT**, where work between CHECKPOINTS are called a **CONTRIBUTION**. A CONTRIBUTION is done per account basis and is the basic steps or project progression.

### Regarding decision making:

  Who decide what is acceptable? How to decide?

  Like I said, why bother.

  For example, in the spider-man project, between CHECKPOINT-A and CHECKPOINT-B, we have to decide what is the main colour of the one of the side villain's suit, red? black? pink? Does the project's original creator just pick whatever he/she wants and pull into the master branch?
  In this situation, we basically are facing the diversion of **UNIVERSE**. If there are five different CONTRIBUTION and none willing to compromise, then the project is branching into five different UNIVERSES, each with a slightly different villain lol. creators can freely chose which villain UNIVERSE they want to participate in, they can still use the RESOURCES from project. After the villain arc is finished, maybe some of the UNIVERSES can merge together in future CHECKPOINT, if they have enough momentum to attract enough creators to reach that point.

  This is central idea behind this, NOBODY owns the project, when you fork/pull a project, you have every freedom to do whatever you want with it, change a dialogue, ship a couple or burn the world down, you do whatever you want. You can choose to put your UNIVERSE onto the shared web and ask others to contribute to your ideal, maybe they will, maybe they wont.

  I believe, we creators, however anti-social we are, should have the tolerance and understanding to come together, bring a commonly loved project to fruition.

### Alright, I see the problem then, wouldn't every project end up with a million UNIVERSES spread everywhere, each CHECKPOINT facing multiple CONTRIBUTION options and the whole project become a huge cluster fuck?

  Well, in worst case scenario, if no collaboration happens, everyone do whatever they please, yes.

  This is why a clear and attractive KEYSTONE is important, and equally important is every creator should compromise and accept our differences.

  Help other like how you want to be helped.

### Finally, if we are sooo lucky and something actually gets done, how to view the content?

  I propose a separate system to view the contents. Since the creative system is going to full of spoiler and messy af.

  Likely there will be several UNIVERSES for viewers to consume based on the same KEYSTONE, maybe there will be several different KEYSTONE because people just can't agree to anything.

  Maybe a curated system? IDK
